# TBL-Remote
A remote designed to make DMing within TBL much easier, with the use of Unified Remote

##Unified remote

Unified Remote is an app to turn your smartphone into a wireless universal remote control for your computer.

These are my custom remotes made to suit my own needs and devices. I made them to work on Windows servers and they require a device with an IR blaster for full functionality. They are not guaranteed to work on other systems.
